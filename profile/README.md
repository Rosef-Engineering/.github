## Let's Electrify Africa 
   

The goal of Rosef is to develop <!-- The goal of Rosef is to develop // This project is a part of Rosef's efforts at developing -->a sustainable solution for electrification, with the main focus being on Africa. More specifically, our target is to start with homes and small businesses in Africa. Owing to the weather conditions in the majority of our target region, solar (photovoltaic) power is the basis of our solution.  
  
Stemming from our goal of minimizing system cost without making compromises, the three key technical concepts of our approach are:  
- **Use of direct energy storage methods**  
Lowering the dependency of renewables on lithium batteries which are expensive and have limited sustainability.  
- **Moving towards the DC future**  
Removing redundant AC/DC conversion and the associated power losses and investment costs.  
- **A smart system which manages resources seamlessly**  
Avoiding compromises and keeping convenience without oversizing the system.

## System Architecture
  
Derived from the concepts above, as well as the needs of our target application, Fig. 1 below depicts a high-level overview of the proposed architecture of a domestic electric installation, including all potential components and some appliances (including redundancies).

Our goal is to develop all dark green components in the schematic above, but our plan is to focus first on the subset shown below in Fig. 2.

## Repositories and Project Status
Below is a list of repositories along with a short description and the status for each.

### [ELV socket PCB](https://github.com/Rosef-Engineering/ELV-socket_PCB)  
The ELV socket is meant to provide an interface for appliances to connect to the ELV bus and to communicate with the system.  
#### Status  


<!-- TODO add repos here -->
