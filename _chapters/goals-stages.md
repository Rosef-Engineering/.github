## Goals
Due to the scope of Rosef's goals, it is necessary to define priorities in order to focus efforts and achieve targets. This prioritization should be done based on required effort as well as importance of functionality for the end user. Based on these points, the following stages have been defined.

### Stage I
For the first goals, functionality such as home lighting and personal device charging (phone, laptop, etc.), may seem like clear choices, due to the ease of implementation as well as usefulness to the end user.
However, given the economic situation of the vast majority of the target demographic, it cannot be ignored that the aforementioned functionality can be viewed merely as a cheaper (and more convenient) solution to the existing alternative (gas lamps and charging as a service).
With low usage, the cost effectiveness of the solution would rely on spreading the investment costs far into the future, which would make the sourcing of investment funds difficult. 
Thus, focusing on productive uses of electricity, which could create a lot of economic opportunity, seems like the better choice.
A robust, repairable and reliable __generic motor drive__, which could easily be adapted to a variety of productive applications, could prove to be useful.
That being said, __interior lighting__ is helpful for productive use cases as much as for domestic ones.

As shown in the resulting block diagram in Fig. 1, the components which need to be developed in order to achieve these targets include:

* __Battery Mini__ - a modular electrical energy storage unit interfaced to the nano-grid through a bidirectional converter
* __PV Mini__ - an MPPT converter for interfacing a photovoltaic solar panel to the nano-grid
* __ELV Socket__ - electronics for interfacing devices to the nano-grid and enabling smart managment of limited resources
* __USB Charger__ - a USB PD charger for personal devices including phones, laptops, etc.
* __Generic Motor Drive__ - a motor drive adaptable to a variety of productive use applications
