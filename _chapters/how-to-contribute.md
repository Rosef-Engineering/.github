To get started, please follow these steps:  
1. Understand the system architecture described in the [Requirements and Architecture repository](https://github.com/Rosef-Engineering/requirements-and-architecture).  
2. Go through the [list of repositories](https://github.com/Rosef-Engineering#repositories-and-project-status) and see which parts of the project are open for contributions. Select one.  
3. Find the selected component in [this list](https://github.com/Rosef-Engineering/requirements-and-architecture#repository-content) and understand its architecture.  
4. Fork the project to your personal github profile.  
5. Clone the forked repo and implement the contributions you would like to submit.  
6. Take care to follow any licence related rules relevant for that repo.
