## Component Architecture
  
In the diagrams in the previous section, the subject of this project (ELV socket) is depicted on a high level, as it would connect to other parts of the system. As can be inferred, the ELV socket is meant to provide an interface for appliances to connect to the ELV bus and to communicate with the system.  
The ELV socket connects to an ELV bus at the input and provides multiple outputs at the same voltage level, each with a limited current capacity. The ELV socket also connects to the Rosef CAN (RCAN) bus on the input side, as well as the Rosef Serial Interface (RSI) on the output side.
