## Repository Content

The goal of this repository and its contents is to document the design of the system and its components in order to enable technical discussions and development coordination. In the long term, the target is to have detailed requirements and architecture, assuring traceability and consistency throughout the development process.  
Currently, the block diagrams are created in [Ipe](https://ipe.otfried.org/), exported in svg format and combined with markdown text. In addition, some parts, which are best suited for tabular representation, are in the form of spreadsheets.
